# PCALipids

Principal components analysis is a standart approach to study conformational changes in biological molecules, in particular when the free energy lanscape has only one global minima. PCAlipids is a Python-based software that performs complete quantitative analysis of conformations and dynamics of lipids or other small molecules. The information about the approach can be found in the following papers:

* [Principal Component Analysis of Lipid Molecule Conformational Changes in Molecular Dynamics Simulations, Buslaev et al., JCTC 2016](doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.5b01106)
* [Effects of Coarse Graining and Saturation of Hydrocarbon Chains on Structure and Dynamics of Simulated Lipid Molecules, Buslaev & Gushchin, Sci. Rep. 2017](doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-11761-5)

You can find the information on installation and a brief tutorial [here](https://github.com/membrane-systems/PCAlipids/blob/master/tutorial/tutorial.md).
