# PCALipids

Principal component analysis is a standard approach to study conformational changes in biological molecules, in particular when the free energy lanscape has only one global minima. PCAlipids is a Python-based software that performs complete quantitative analysis of conformations and dynamics of lipids or other small molecules. The information about the approach can be found in the following papers:
